# AutoBulb Project
## Overview
A project to create lightbulbs that turn on in the presence of *warm bodies* (i.e. People, Dogs, Cats, etc.), and off when they leave.

## Prototyping
This project is in the prototyping stages, and thus everything that follows are instructions on making a single prototype. 

For help on the project, I started here, at the [Central Nexus Thermal Camera Project](http://www.centralnexus.com/thermal/)

## Parts
Here are the parts that are needed for this project:
- Arduino (Uno was used for this project)
  - A prototyping microcontroller, programmed using C++-ish.
- MLX90614ESF-DCI
  - A infrared temperature sensor
  - Place to Buy: [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/melexis-technologies-nv/MLX90614ESF-DCI-000-SP/MLX90614ESF-DCI-000-SP-ND/5416206)
  - [Datasheet](/Assorted%20Extra%20Info/MLX90614-Datasheet-Melexis.pdf)
- The necessary wires and a breadboard for testing
